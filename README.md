# Tabular text formatting for geoscience data

The GeoCSV format is a dialect of the model developed by the W3Câ€™s [CSV on the Web Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page).

The headers allow for common metadata to be included with a tabular text dataset and the specification is extensible, allowing for domain-specific headers to be added as needed. The defined annotations are designed for use as additions to exisiting text data or new structured text data.
